Core Feature Elaboration:

	-Tilemap editing window:
		-Similar to the original world-builder, with additional features
		--Can have multiple tilemaps open at once
		--Tile selection pane (right)
		-Buttons and key shortcuts for:
			--Draw
			--Move
			--Show/hide grid
			--Toggle border visibility
			--Tilemap layer
			--Decoration layer
			--Collision map
			--Loading zone layer
			--Lighting layer
			-Switching between panels for individual tiles and tile assemblies
			--Dropdown box for selecting tile group
		
		--Tile collections:
			--These are configurable groupings of tiles to make it easier to find specific tiles
			--Better optimized loading:
				--Build panels on startup and on configuring, rather than on every switch
				--New "TileGroup" class for panels
			--Hard-coded group of "All" tiles
		
		-Tile assemblies:?
			-These are multi-tile objects that allow one to place structures quicklyâ€”like trees, for example
			-Allows you to configure the height-value of decos
			-The will have their own panel and collections
			-Hard-coded group of "All" tile groups

		-Patterns:
			-These are templates that place multiple of the same tile in a defined pattern
			-For example: A template for placing an arbitrary tile in a 3x3 shape rather than a 1x1

		--Collision geometry editor:
			--Allows you to edit the collision geometry of a tile or tile assembly and apply to the map
				X-Prompt that asks if you want to apply changes to specially modified tiles
			--Toggleable collision map overlay.

		--Border:
			-The border is a region, marked by warning tape, that the player cannot see
			--This allows for placing loading zones just outside the map, rather than awkwardly just before
			X-The tiles here can be configured between solid and non-solid
			--The border's visibility in the editor can be toggled using a button

		-Quality of life tools:
			--Undo/redo buttons w/ keyboard shortcuts
			--Separate row/column and x/y coordinate indicator
			--Tool to change tilemap size
			-"Draw-line" tool triggered by holding "shift"
				-Releasing "shift" cancels, and blocks further drawing until mouse button is released
				-Line indicator visible while in use
			-Tool that opens the level that a loading zone is referring to
		
	-World-view window:
		-A map of the various levels, linked together based on how to get from one to another
		-Creating/destroying a loading zone automatically adds/removes a connection
		-Locations of each level is player controlled
			-To avoid accidentally messing up the placements, they MUST be placed manually
		-Can be used as a quick-access to open available levels
		-Optional, and only accessible if a project file is detected
		-Each level icon will have a miniature render of the level (img matrix saved to project file)
		-Support for scrolling/moving around the view window
		-Search-bar to find entities (level-name dictionary saved to project file)
